Jigger Up <Version 0.5> 01/17/2019

A flask web app developed to demonstrate skills representative of my time and experience at Coding Temple. Incorporates use of HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask and Bootstrap4. Highlighted features include API calls, JSONs, email password recovery and dynamic content.

This application returns beverage recipes as the intersection of multiple ingredients passed as search parameters at it's core. With it's full implementation, it allows a user to manage their own virtual pantry and automatically makes suggestions based on it's contents.
